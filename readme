NOTE : you can use this service with 300.00 initial credit but it can be used rapidly  - especially if you are not well versed in the resource utilization
If you have a google account (e.g. gmail) you may be able to get started initially 
Best Practice is to “disable” billing for a project after you have completed it. 

Install “go”
sudo apt-get update
